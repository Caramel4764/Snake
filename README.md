# Snake

This is a summer project making the classic game snake from scratch. The goal is to control the snake and eat apples. For each apple the snake eats, it grows 1 block. If the snake touches the border wall or itself, it dies and the game is over. A leaderboard is added to practice node.js and mongodb and will only prompt the user for a name if their score is at least high than top 10.
